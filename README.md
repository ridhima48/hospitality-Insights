## Recommendations:
- Atliq Palace in Hyderabad is struggling with low bookings, potentially due to low ratings. As a business hotel, its high ADR of 9,480 rupees and low Occupancy percentage need attention.
- Atliq Grands in Hyderabad is another hotel with lower revenue due to poor ratings and low Occupancy percentage. Efforts should focus on increasing bookings.
- ADR should be adjusted dynamically based on factors like the city, weekdays, and low-demand days to maximize revenue.
- As Occumpancy is fluctuating week on week however rates are not fluctuated meaning they have fixed pricing. However during the months of may, june and july there is summer holiday so occupancy is high and thus they should use dynamic pricing.
- The decline in revenue is primarily linked to low Occupancy percentages, which, in turn, result from fewer bookings. Strategies should be devised to enhance booking rates.
